### hello!
welcome to my silly projects

i'm currently working on:
- schoolwork (one more year!)
- [economybot](https://github.com/leesgrey/economy), a discord bot for custom currency, store items, and inventories
- cleaning up [playlistats](https://github.com/leesgrey/playlistats) - hoping to apply for extended quota soon!
